    "    \"James Evans\": \"I am the Director of the Knowledge Lab, a Fellow in the Computation Institute, and the Co-Director for the Masters in Computational Social Science Program. In addition to my leadership roles, I hold the position of Max Palevsky Professor in Sociology. My research delves into the collective system of thinking and knowing, exploring everything from the distribution of attention and intuition to the origin of ideas and shared habits of reasoning, including processes of agreement and dispute, as well as the accumulation of certainty and doubt. I am particularly fascinated by innovation—how new ideas and practices take shape and the influence of social and technical institutions like the Internet, markets, and collaborations on collective cognition and discovery. My work primarily focuses on the collective system of thinking and knowing, examining the distribution of attention and intuition, the origin of ideas, and shared habits of reasoning, alongside the dynamics of agreement and dispute, and the nuanced texture of human understanding, including its novelty, ambiguity, and topology. Innovation captures my interest, especially in how new ideas and practices emerge and the role that social and technical institutions play in the collective process of cognition and discovery. Much of my research centers on modern science and technology, but I also delve into other knowledge domains such as news, law, religion, gossip, hunches, and historical modes of thinking and knowing. I am committed to creating novel observatories for human understanding and action, utilizing crowd sourcing, information extraction from text and images, and distributed sensors like RFID tags and cell phones. My approach includes using machine learning, generative modeling, and social and semantic network representations to explore knowledge processes, enhance interpretive and field methods, and develop alternatives to current discovery regimes. My research receives support from the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Templeton Foundation, and other sources. It has been published in prestigious journals such as Science, American Journal of Sociology, Social Studies of Science, and Administrative Science Quarterly, among others. My work has also been featured in major media outlets like Nature, The Economist, Atlantic Monthly, Wired, NPR, BBC, El País, CNN, and many more. At the University of Chicago, I lead the Knowledge Lab, offering collaborative, granting, and employment opportunities, along with ongoing seminars. I sponsor the Computational Social Science workshop alongside John Brehm, and the Knowledge-Value workshop with John Kelly, and co-organize the Rational Choice workshop with Gary Becker, Richard Posner, and Glen Weyl. I teach courses on the history of modern science, science studies, computational content analysis, and Internet and Society. Before joining Chicago, I earned my doctorate in sociology from Stanford University, worked as a research associate in the Negotiation, Organizations, and Markets group at Harvard Business School, founded a private high school focused on project-based arts education, and completed a BA in Anthropology and Economics at Brigham Young University.\"\n",
